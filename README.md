# Make a real time chat app - Shaastra Workshop 2021

This repository contains the starter code for the chat app for the workshop.

This needs to be downloaded on your computers before you start with the hands on session. 

# How to use the starter code?

1. The starter code contains the minimal stuff you need, to get started with understanding Node, MongoDB and Socket.io
2. Some parts have been pre-implemented. These parts are intended to make you understand the syntax of various functions and web API calls. These parts will also be explained in the workshop
3. Rest of the parts have to be implemented by you. These parts will be coded live during the workshop :)



The chat app supports real time messaging and file transfer.

# Running the app
1. Create a database named letschat in your local MongoDB instance
2. Run npm install 
3. Run npm start

Happy Coding!
